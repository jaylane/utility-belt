- Think when AutoSalvage bails due to open vendor (thanks Cosmic Jester)
- Visual VTank Nav Lines (like vi2 blue nav lines, but fully customizable and local)
- Hopefully fix issue where AutoVendor would get stuck with pyreals (instead of buying notes)
- Dont try to sell / salvage retained
- Added `/ub ig` ItemGiver command to give items matching a loot profile to another player (thanks Schneebly)
- Added `/ub jump` commands (thanks Schneebly)
- AutoVendor now requires id data for everything, to properly check for tinkered and retained. (TODO: inventory cache)
- AutoVendor will no longer sell inscribed items (thanks Cosmic Jester)
